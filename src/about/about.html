        <p>I am a developer in training working my way through Coding Dojo's 
            14 week bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to graduate and work in the Boston Area as a full stack web developer,
            with an emphasis on Linux servers, operations, and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm done with the program, I hope to practice working with Python
            (including tehnologies such as Flask and Django), the MEAN stack 
            (including Nodejs, Mongo db, the Express framework, Angular.js) and
            Java technologies, including the Spring framework, the play framework,
            the various Java package managers and the advantages and disadvantages of 
            each.
        </p>
        <p>I also plan to sharpen my operations skills, and practice deploying 
            the above aplications using various build tools, continious integration
            systems, configuration management systems, and monitioring solutions.
