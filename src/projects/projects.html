        <h1>Skyler Daché</h1>
        <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <p>I am a developer in training working my way through Coding Dojo's 
            14 week bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to graduate and work in the Boston Area as a full stack web developer,
            with an emphasis on Linux servers, operations, and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm done with the program, I hope to practice working with Python
            (including tehnologies such as Flask and Django), the MEAN stack 
            (including Nodejs, Mongo db, the Express framework, Angular.js) and
            Java technologies, including the Spring framework, the play framework,
            the various Java package managers and the advantages and disadvantages of 
            each.
        </p>
        <p>I also plan to sharpen my operations skills, and practice deploying 
            the above aplications using various build tools, continious integration
            systems, configuration management systems, and monitioring solutions.

                <h3>Food Ordering System</h3>
                <p>
                    This project recreates the food ordering point of sale system at the
                    restaraunt I have worked at.  It allows servers to view and enter orders
                    for food and drinks, keeps track of what has been ordered and the supply of
                    ingredients required to make items, it displays to line cooks what ingredients
                    need to be combined to make ordered food, and allows managers to void/comp orders,
                    track sales, profits, losses, and order/payment activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Food Ordering System is built with all Javascript/Typescript,

                <h3>League of Legends Calculator</h3>
                <p>
                    I hope to develop a simple calculator for predicting the outcome of 
                    combat in the online multiplayer video game League of Legends.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>League</span> is a complex game where
                    players can fight while moving, where combat effectivness is highly
                    situational and subject to a large number of rules, and where the
                    correct strategey is to advance on the enemy when you expect to win,
                    and to retreat when you expect to lose.  The ability to asses a combat
                    situation and determine if it is a winning fight or a losing fight is 
                    thus and essential skill in <span>League</span>.  This is why developing
                    a calculator for answering this question would be such an interesting 
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start, I will develop the capability to evaluate simple combat
                    under constrained conditions.  Next I will branch it out to cover 
                    more of the rules and conditions, but still with strict assumptions
                    about the combatants' combat performance and decision making, such 
                    assuming every attack will hit, or that both opponents will waste no 
                    time in between moves or attacks.  After that, I will add the
                    functionality to let users arbitrarily modify assumptions like these,
                    and see how that would influence who wins and by how much.

                <h3>Pong App</h3>
                <p>
                    The Pong app is a simple multiplayer game that allows people to register, log in,
                    create/join games, and play multiplayer pong with their arrow keys against another
                    player.

                    This project uses A Java server, using the spring web framework, WebSocets
                    for real time communication,
