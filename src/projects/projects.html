            <h3>Food Ordering System</h3>
            <p>
                This project recreates the food ordering point of sale system at the
                restaraunt I have worked at.  It allows servers to view and enter orders
                for food and drinks, keeps track of what has been ordered and the supply of
                ingredients required to make items, it displays to line cooks what ingredients
                need to be combined to make ordered food, and allows managers to void/comp orders,
                track sales, profits, losses, and order/payment activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Food Ordering System is built with all Javascript/Typescript,

            <h3>League of Legends Calculator</h3>
            <p>
                I hope to develop a simple calculator for predicting the outcome of 
                combat in the online multiplayer video game League of Legends.        
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>League</span> is a complex game where
                players can fight while moving, where combat effectivness is highly
                situational and subject to a large number of rules, and where the
                correct strategey is to advance on the enemy when you expect to win,
                and to retreat when you expect to lose.  The ability to asses a combat
                situation and determine if it is a winning fight or a losing fight is 
                thus and essential skill in <span>League</span>.  This is why developing
                a calculator for answering this question would be such an interesting 
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start, I will develop the capability to evaluate simple combat
                under constrained conditions.  Next I will branch it out to cover 
                more of the rules and conditions, but still with strict assumptions
                about the combatants' combat performance and decision making, such 
                assuming every attack will hit, or that both opponents will waste no 
                time in between moves or attacks.  After that, I will add the
                functionality to let users arbitrarily modify assumptions like these,
                and see how that would influence who wins and by how much.

            <h3>Pong App</h3>
            <p>
                The Pong app is a simple multiplayer game that allows people to register, log in,
                create/join games, and play multiplayer pong with their arrow keys against another
                player.

                This project uses A Java server, using the spring web framework, WebSocets
                for real time communication,
