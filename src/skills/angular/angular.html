        <h2>Angular</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Angular is the preimere Javascript/Typescript front end web framework for creating
            user interfaces using a declaritave, object-oriented style.  It features a 
            component-based architecture whereby components are isolated by default and need to 
            declare a dependency in order to send or recieve data to other components, which they
            can also do using services.
        </p>
        <h3>My experience</h3>
        <p>
            I first learned about Angularjs, the previous version of Angular, back in 2014 when I 
            was writing a simple audit tool for Common Sense Solutions.  I learned about the basics
            of Web development while developing this tool for them.
            While I didn't make the best code in 2014, I did read a book called "Single Page web 
            Applications" that sold me on the value of putting everything into the browsesr, and
            this helped me understand the ideas behind Angular, and the different design decisions
            that are involved in making it work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, in the fall of 2018, I dove deep into javascript development at Coding Dojo and 
            learned all about the new version of Angular.  By listening to lectures, watching
            videos, and completing a lot of assignments, I eventually achieved enough basic 
            proficiency in Angular to actually make a full featured application by myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating from Coding Dojo, I gradually developed the food ordering system during late 2018 and 2019.
        </p>
        <h3>How I use Angular</h3>
        <p>
            Angular is best when you want an dynamic and reactive web based front end with a large 
            amount of functionality, that is, if you want a single page application.
            Angular is especially appropriate if that functionality is easily broken down into 
            logical modules that correspond to components of the graphical interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            The downside of using Angular is the fact that developing a single page application
            requires substantial extra development time to make the app work in both the browser 
            and the server, especially if security or performance considerations require putting 
            significant business logic on the server. I would avoid using angular if I needed 
            simple web site, or if there was no need the responsivness of a single page web 
            application, or if angular's component-based architechture failed to model the domain,
            such as if I tended to frequently needed every component to talk to every other 
            component in hard-to-define ways.
