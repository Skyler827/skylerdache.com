        <h1>Skyler Daché</h1>
        <h3>Developer in training, never ending student</h3>
        <p>I am a developer in training working my way through Coding Dojo's 
            14 week bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to graduate and work in the Boston Area as a full stack web developer,
            with an emphasis on Linux servers, operations, and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm done with the program, I hope to practice working with Python
            (including tehnologies such as Flask and Django), the MEAN stack 
            (including Nodejs, Mongo db, the Express framework, Angular.js) and
            Java technologies, including the Spring framework, the play framework,
            the various Java package managers and the advantages and disadvantages of 
            each.
        </p>
        <p>I also plan to sharpen my operations skills, and practice deploying 
            the above aplications using various build tools, continious integration
            systems, configuration management systems, and monitioring solutions.

                <h3>League of Legends Calculator</h3>
                <p>I hope to develop a simple calculator for predicting the outcome of 
                    combat in the online multiplayer video game <span>League of 
                    Legends</span>.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>League</span> is a complex game where
                    players can fight while moving, where combat effectivness is highly
                    situational and subject to a large number of rules, and where the
                    correct strategey is to advance on the enemy when you expect to win,
                    and to retreat when you expect to lose.  The ability to asses a combat
                    situation and determine if it is a winning fight or a losing fight is 
                    thus and essential skill in <span>League</span>.  This is why developing
                    a calculator for answering this question would be such an interesting 
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start, I will develop the capability to evaluate simple combat
                    under constrained conditions.  Next I will branch it out to cover 
                    more of the rules and conditions, but still with strict assumptions
                    about the combatants' combat performance and decision making, such 
                    assuming every attack will hit, or that both opponents will waste no 
                    time in between moves or attacks.  After that, I will add the
                    functionality to let users arbitrarily modify assumptions like these,
                    and see how that would influence who wins and by how much.

                <h3>Maryland Lottery Calculator</h3>
                <p>
                    I think Lotteries are dumb.  I think (along with gambling) that
                    they are a tax on the poor and a symptom of poor numeracy.  I think
                    there should be more tools onlie for seeing how much of a bad investment
                    Lotteries are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I would like to develop a tool that analyzes the various different
                    kinds of tokens, tickets, bets, and points involved in the Maryland
                    Lottery, chosen because a friend of mine seems to think that by picking
                    the right bets and doing the right math, he could actually make money
                    playing the lottery.  Crazy, I know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I want the application to
                    act like it is answering his question.  It will be specifically about
                    analyzing and evaluating the value of different kinds of tickets and bets.
                    So it will be for him, but also for anyone who has been tricked into
                    thinking that the Lottery works for them.

                <h3>Basketball Fantasy Football analyzer</h3>
                <p>Just for fun, my classmate and reportedly pretty cool guy Allen said 
                    that it would be pretty cool to write a program to procedurally 
                    estimate optimal basketball draft picks.  I said sure.  So I
                    guess I'm making a pro basketball draft picking tool.</p>
